Sometimes IPTV providers restrict access to m3u or xtream api sources only to IPs from a specific country or block access to IP servers.
IPTVEditor Bypass is a tool that allows you to overcome these limitations imposed by your IPTV provider, allowing you to fully use IPTVEditor's features. 
The only limitation is the auto updater cannot be run automatically, but must be started manually by clicking on the "Run now" button.

How the tool works:
Download the zipper file, you will find the link at the end of the page.
Inside the zipper file you will find 3 files:
- iptveditor4_bypass-win.exe: for windows
- iptveditor4_bypass-macos for macos
- iptveditor4_bypass-linux for linux

Run the file according to your operating system.

Is the program safe?
Of course it is. The program is a lightweight web server, no files are installed, no changes are made to your computer.
